# Analysis-on-Spotify-Dataset
## Problem Statement
### Music taste is subjective but repetitive, which means song listeners can have preference for certain Music Genres over others. Genre classification is a critical task for Music platforms like Spotify as it helps artists connect with new audiences. The volumne of new songs released everyday is in millions so automating this task is of paramount importance. However this is only possible when Genres have unique characteristics which differentiate them from each other. With this dataset we will explore the following:

* #### Understanding the song preferences of Spotify userbase. 
* #### It will also serve as a good approximation of song preferences of millennials since majority of Spotify userbase is millennial.
* #### What are the key characteristics of a Song Genre?
* #### What Factors contribute to Song Popularity?
